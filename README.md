CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. <br>
It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. <br>
It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL. <br>

CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and user interfaces for many mobile applications.<br>

## Why use CSS
These are the **three major benefits of CSS**:

### 1) Solves a big problem
Before **CSS**, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process. For example: If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will be become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. It was a W3C recommendation.

### 2) Saves a lot of time
**CSS** style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.

### 3) Provide more attributes
**CSS** provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.
